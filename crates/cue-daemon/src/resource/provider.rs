//! Resource scheduling: provider abstraction.
//!
//! A `Provider` is the daemon's plug-in point for one class of resources
//! (e.g. NVIDIA GPUs via NVML, or a TPU pool exposed by an external CLI
//! script). Providers are completely opaque to the rest of the daemon: the
//! scheduler never reasons about specific resource keys, it just routes the
//! job's `Need` map to whichever provider claims each key.
//!
//! ## Contract
//! * `id()` — unique provider identifier (e.g. `"gpu"`). Used for stable
//!   ordering and diagnostics.
//! * `keys()` — the `need.<key>` names this provider owns. The registry
//!   asserts that every key is claimed by **at most one** provider; a
//!   collision aborts daemon startup rather than silently shadowing.
//! * `probe()` — fresh capacity snapshot for `:resources`. Implementations
//!   may cache internally (e.g. NVML provider has its own TTL); the
//!   registry calls through without enforcing a global TTL.
//! * `reserve(req)` — acquire the bytes/count described by `req.need`.
//!   Implementations are expected to serialise themselves with their own
//!   internal `Mutex` so that concurrent admission attempts can't race over
//!   the same physical unit.
//! * `release(grant_id)` — release a previously granted reservation by id.
//!   Best-effort: no error is propagated, since terminal job paths must
//!   always succeed.
//!
//! All methods are synchronous. The daemon's scheduler runs admission off
//! the actor thread when needed; providers internally must not block for
//! more than a small bounded interval (TTL-cached probes, short
//! `Command::output` calls for CLI providers, etc.).
