## Background and Existing Architecture

### Wire Protocol

All cue-shell IPC uses **length-prefixed JSON framing** defined in `cue-core/src/ipc.rs`:

```
[ 4 bytes: u32 big-endian body length ][ UTF-8 JSON body ]
```

The `Message` envelope is tagged JSON with three variants:

| Variant    | Direction       | Purpose                                    |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Request`  | Client → cued   | User commands, pings, subscriptions        |
| `Response` | cued → Client   | Correlated replies (matched by `id: u32`)  |
| `Event`    | cued → Client   | Server-pushed async notifications          |

Max message size: 16 MiB (`MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`).

### Transport Abstraction

The key insight is that the entire client stack is already transport-agnostic:

```rust
// cue-client/src/client.rs
pub trait ClientStream: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Send + Unpin {}
impl<T> ClientStream for T where T: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Send + Unpin {}
```

`CuedClient::from_stream(stream)` accepts any `S: ClientStream + 'static`. The
reconnect manager (`cue-client/src/reconnect.rs`) is parameterized by a
`ClientConnector` closure that returns `CuedClient` — it does not care what
transport produced the stream.

```rust
pub struct ClientConnector {
    connect: Arc<dyn Fn() -> ConnectFuture + Send + Sync>,
}
```

**Any new transport only needs to produce an `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` stream.**
The framing, reconnect, and event routing layers reuse verbatim.

Client-side profile parsing and target settings live in `cue-client` as well:
`transport_config.rs` resolves `client.toml` into `ResolvedTransport`,
`transport_settings.rs` builds target-list snapshots, and `host_discovery.rs`
implements generic opt-in inventory sources. Scheduler/site-specific variables
belong in `client.toml` `[transport.discovery]` or external `cue-*` extensions;
they are not hardcoded into the core client stack. External frontends such as Pi
cue integrations should use the machine-readable client CLI bridge when they
need to honor `client.toml`:

```text
cue-client target resolve --json
cue client target resolve --json
cue-client target list --json
```

The top-level aggregator deliberately uses the explicit client namespace; there
is no `cue target ...` shortcut. Talking directly to a daemon socket bypasses
client profile selection.

### Current State

| Transport | Server side          | Client side                           | Reconnect |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Unix      | `actor/gateway.rs`   | `CuedClient::connect(socket_path)`    | ✅ full   |
| SSH stdio | `gateway_stdio.rs`   | `SshChildStream` / connector helpers in `cue-client/src/ssh_transport.rs` | ⚠️ partial |
| HTTP      | —                    | —                                     | ❌ none   |
| Chain     | —                    | —                                     | ❌ none   |

## Mode 1: HTTP Transport

### 1.1 Current State

No HTTP transport exists. This would allow clients to connect to `cued` over a
network port instead of a Unix socket — useful for remote development, container
environments, IDE plugins, and web UIs.

### 1.2 Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: REST polling + SSE for events

HTTP `POST /request` for commands; HTTP `GET /events` (Server-Sent Events) for
pushed events.

**Pros**:
- Human-readable, debuggable with `curl`
- SSE is firewall-friendly (unidirectional, plain HTTP/1.1)
- Easy to implement with `axum`

**Cons**:
- Inherently two connections per client (request channel + event channel)
- Request/response correlation is handled by the HTTP request/response cycle —
  but SSE events are not correlated with individual requests, requiring a
  session-ID header or cookie
- Polling adds latency for any operation that needs a quick response
- `FgInput`/`FgOutput` (PTY data) requires binary framing or base64 over SSE;
  SSE is text-only
- **Breaks the `ClientStream` model** — would need a completely new client
  abstraction layer

#### Option B: HTTP/2 with server push

Use `h2` or `hyper` + HTTP/2 server push frames for daemon-to-client messages.

**Pros**:
- Multiplexed streams over a single TCP connection
- Server push is standardized

**Cons**:
- HTTP/2 server push was [removed from browsers](https://crbug.com/1201674) and
  is deprecated for general use
- `h2` crate is low-level; setting up a push-based server is non-trivial
- Still requires TLS in most contexts
- Does not map naturally to the existing `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` stream model

#### Option C: HTTP/3 (QUIC)

Use `quinn` crate to speak QUIC natively.

**Pros**:
- Multiplexed, 0-RTT reconnect, no head-of-line blocking
- Built-in TLS 1.3

**Cons**:
- QUIC is UDP-based; many corporate firewalls block UDP port 443
- `quinn` API is more complex than WebSocket
- Overkill for local-network or loopback use
- No existing `quinn` dependency in the workspace

#### Option D: WebSocket (tokio-tungstenite / axum) — **RECOMMENDED**

Upgrade an HTTP/1.1 connection to WebSocket. Each WebSocket message carries
exactly one length-prefixed JSON IPC message (i.e., the same 4-byte header +
JSON body that Unix clients send). The `SinkExt`/`StreamExt` WebSocket API is
wrapped in a thin `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` adapter, giving back a `ClientStream`
with **zero changes to the upper layers**.

```
Client                         cued (HTTP gateway)
  │── HTTP GET /ws (Upgrade) ──►│
  │◄── 101 Switching Protocols ─│
  │                              │
  │── WS binary frame ──────────►│  (4-byte prefix + JSON)
  │◄── WS binary frame ──────────│  (4-byte prefix + JSON)
```

**Pros**:
- Full duplex, single connection, works through load balancers
- Binary frames preserve the existing framing intact — `read_message` /
  `encode_message` in `cue-core` need no changes
- `axum` is the natural fit: `axum::extract::ws::WebSocket` is already
  `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`-compatible via a small adapter
- `tokio-tungstenite` provides a standalone client without requiring axum
- Firewall-friendly (standard port 80/443, HTTP upgrade handshake)
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on the upgrade request
- TLS: standard `tokio-rustls` / `axum-server` with TLS acceptor

**Cons**:
- Slightly more setup than raw TCP (HTTP upgrade round-trip)
- WebSocket framing overhead (~2–14 bytes per frame) — negligible vs. JSON body

**Implementation sketch**:

```rust
// Server side — add to cued alongside gateway.rs
// crates/cue-daemon/src/actor/gateway_ws.rs

use axum::{Router, extract::ws::{WebSocket, WebSocketUpgrade}, routing::get};
use tokio::io::duplex;

pub fn router(sys: ActorSystem) -> Router {
    Router::new()
        .route("/ws", get(move |ws: WebSocketUpgrade| {
            let sys = sys.clone();
            async move { ws.on_upgrade(|socket| handle_ws_client(socket, sys)) }
        }))
}

async fn handle_ws_client(ws: WebSocket, sys: ActorSystem) {
    // Wrap ws into AsyncRead + AsyncWrite, then call the existing
    // handle_client logic (currently UnixStream-specific, to be refactored).
    let stream = ws_to_stream(ws);
    let client_id = NEXT_CLIENT_ID.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    handle_client_generic(client_id, stream, sys, ...).await;
}
```

The `handle_client` function in `actor/gateway.rs` currently takes a
`UnixStream`. Refactoring it to accept `impl AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin`
(or the boxed `BoxedClientStream`) enables reuse for both Unix and WebSocket
clients.

```rust
// Client side — cue-client/src/reconnect.rs
impl ClientConnector {
    pub fn websocket(url: String, token: Option<String>) -> Self {
        Self::new(move || {
            let url = url.clone();
            let token = token.clone();
            async move {
                let (ws, _) = tokio_tungstenite::connect_async(
                    tungstenite::client::IntoClientRequest::into_client_request(url)?
                ).await?;
                // wrap ws in WsStream adapter (AsyncRead + AsyncWrite)
                Ok(CuedClient::from_stream(WsStream::new(ws)))
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### 1.3 Recommended Approach

**WebSocket over HTTP/1.1 using `axum`** (Option D), reusing the existing
length-prefixed JSON framing over binary WebSocket frames.

Rationale:
- Zero protocol changes — same wire format as Unix socket
- Single `ClientStream` adapter bridges the two transports at the leaf level
- `axum` is the right-fit HTTP framework for Tokio (tower middleware for auth,
  TLS via `axum-server`)
- `tokio-tungstenite` for the client side; `axum` for the server side

### 1.4 TOML Configuration Schema

```toml
# ~/.config/cue-shell/client.toml

[transport]
default_profile = "remote-http"

[transport.profiles.remote-http]
transport = "http"
url = "ws://192.168.1.10:8765/ws"   # or wss:// for TLS
# token = "secret-bearer-token"     # optional; sent as Authorization: Bearer
# tls_ca_cert = "/path/to/ca.pem"  # optional; for self-signed certs
```

Daemon side (`cued` config):

```toml
# ~/.config/cue-shell/daemon.toml

[http_gateway]
enabled = true
bind = "0.0.0.0:8765"
# tls_cert = "/path/to/cert.pem"
# tls_key  = "/path/to/key.pem"
# auth_token = "secret-bearer-token"   # if set, all WS upgrade requests must
#                                       # include Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### 1.5 New Rust Dependencies

Add to `Cargo.toml` (workspace):

```toml
axum            = { version = "0.8", features = ["ws"] }        # server WS
tokio-tungstenite = { version = "0.24", features = ["native-tls"] } # client WS
```

TLS (optional, behind a feature flag):

```toml
axum-server     = { version = "0.7", features = ["tls-rustls"] }
tokio-rustls    = "0.26"
```

### 1.6 Implementation Steps

1. **Refactor `handle_client`** in `actor/gateway.rs` to be generic over
   `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin` (extract stream type, keep all routing
   logic). This removes the hard `UnixStream` dependency.

2. **Add `gateway_ws.rs`** crate in `cued`: spawn a `tokio::net::TcpListener`,
   hand connections to `axum` (or raw `hyper` upgrade). On upgrade, wrap the
   WebSocket in a `WsStream` adapter and call the generic `handle_client`.

3. **Add `WsStream` adapter** in `cue-client` (or a shared location): wraps
   `tokio_tungstenite::WebSocketStream` and implements `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`
   by translating binary frames to/from a byte buffer.

4. **Add `ClientConnector::websocket`** constructor in `cue-client/src/reconnect.rs`.

5. **Extend `TransportProfile`** enum in `cue-client/src/transport_config.rs`
   with an HTTP/WebSocket variant. Reuse cue-client connector construction from
   CLI and TUI frontends so WebSocket connector creation stays behind the shared
   resolver boundary.

6. **Add auth middleware** using `axum` tower layer: extract
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the upgrade request headers.

7. **Wire up in `cued start`**: if `[http_gateway] enabled = true`, spawn the
   HTTP listener task alongside the Unix listener.

## Mode 2: SSH Transport (Completion)

### 2.1 Current State

The SSH transport is **usable from both CLI startup and TUI live reconnect**:

- **`cue-client/src/ssh_transport.rs`** (`connect_ssh_transport`,
  `transport_connector`): fully implements subprocess SSH with
  `ssh <destination> <gateway_command>`, wraps the child's stdin/stdout as an
  `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` stream, performs a `Ping/Pong` handshake to verify
  the tunnel, and constructs a `CuedClient` from the stream. The shared
  `ClientConnector` re-invokes `connect_ssh_transport` on reconnect.

- **`cue-client::transport_connector`** is the shared connector factory for
  resolved transport profiles. `cue-tui` live target switching consumes that
  factory, so both Unix and SSH profiles can build a live reconnect connector
  from the same resolved `client.toml` semantics.

- **Auto-start**: the SSH transport has no mechanism to run `start_command` on
  the remote when the gateway connection fails (unlike Unix where
  `ensure_daemon_running` auto-starts `cued`). The TUI treats initial SSH
  unavailability as offline mode and relies on the shared reconnect loop;
  `cue run` still fails fast because script execution cannot proceed without a
  live daemon.

### 2.2 Alternative Approaches for the SSH Client Layer

#### Option A: Subprocess `ssh` (current approach) — **RECOMMENDED**

Spawn `ssh <destination> "cued gateway --stdio"` as a Tokio child process, wrap
stdin/stdout as `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`.

**Pros**:
- Already implemented and working in `cue-client`
- Inherits all OpenSSH features: agent forwarding (`-A`), jump hosts (`-J`),
  `~/.ssh/config`, ControlMaster multiplexing, known_hosts verification
- Zero Rust SSH implementation to maintain
- `kill_on_drop(true)` on the child ensures cleanup

**Cons**:
- Requires `ssh` binary on PATH (not an issue for developer machines)
- Subprocess adds ~50–100 ms handshake latency on first connect
- Reconnect spawns a new process (acceptable — same overhead as manual reconnect)

#### Option B: `openssh` crate

The [`openssh`](https://crates.io/crates/openssh) crate wraps the `ssh` binary
more ergonomically (typed API, ControlMaster session reuse, remote command
execution).

**Pros**:
- `openssh::Session::connect()` returns a reusable session handle
- `session.raw_command("cued gateway --stdio")` gives stdin/stdout streams
- ControlMaster means the second connect uses the existing TCP connection →
  near-zero reconnect latency
- `session.check()` lets the reconnect loop detect a dead connection

**Cons**:
- New dependency (`openssh = "0.10"`)
- Still shells out to `ssh`; no benefit for the basic use case
- ControlMaster path configuration can conflict with the user's own settings

#### Option C: `russh` crate (pure Rust SSH)

[`russh`](https://crates.io/crates/russh) is a pure-Rust async SSH
implementation (client + server).

**Pros**:
- No dependency on `ssh` binary
- Full control over reconnect, known_hosts, and key negotiation
- Could enable SSH server mode inside `cued` itself (accept incoming SSH and
  route to Unix socket), removing the need for `cued gateway --stdio`

**Cons**:
- Substantial new dependency (`russh`, `russh-keys`) with complex async API
- Known_hosts and host key verification must be implemented manually
- Agent forwarding via `russh` requires additional work
- Maintenance burden — crypto library upgrades, CVE tracking
- Overkill: the subprocess approach already works well

#### Option D: `ssh2` crate (libssh2 bindings)

[`ssh2`](https://crates.io/crates/ssh2) wraps `libssh2` (C library).

**Pros**:
- Mature, widely used
- Good known_hosts and key agent support

**Cons**:
- Blocking / callback API — awkward with Tokio (needs `spawn_blocking`)
- Requires `libssh2` C library at link time (complicates static builds)
- Worse than subprocess in every practical dimension for this use case

### 2.3 Recommended Approach

**Keep the subprocess `ssh` approach** (Option A). The connector factory already
lives in `cue-client`, so CLI and TUI frontends share the same Unix/SSH
reconnect semantics. The remaining SSH transport work is:

1. **Add remote auto-start** as a best-effort step before the first connection.
2. **Add SSH invocation options** for keepalive and user-specified flags.
3. **Broaden integration coverage** around TUI live reconnect and SSH connector
   construction.

### 2.4 TOML Configuration Schema

No changes needed. The existing schema already captures everything:

```toml
[transport.profiles.devbox]
transport = "ssh"
destination = "devbox"                       # ssh(1) destination
gateway_command = "cued gateway --stdio"     # executed on remote
start_command = "cued start"                 # run once if daemon not found
# Extra SSH options (passed via -o or prepended to command):
# ssh_options = ["-A", "-o", "ServerAliveInterval=10"]
```

`local` is reserved for the built-in Unix socket profile; SSH profiles must use
another name such as `devbox`.

Proposed new optional field:

```toml
[transport.profiles.devbox]
# ...existing fields...
auto_start = true       # attempt start_command on first ping failure (default: true)
ssh_options = ["-A"]    # additional ssh(1) flags prepended to the invocation
```

### 2.5 Remaining Implementation Steps

Already complete in the current architecture:

1. `cue-client/src/ssh_transport.rs` owns `SshChildStream`,
   `connect_ssh_transport`, and `transport_connector`.
2. `cue-client target resolve/list` and `cue-tui` both resolve profiles through
   `cue-client` transport config.
3. `cue-tui/src/target_config.rs::connector_for_profile` delegates to
   `cue_client::transport_connector`, so live target switching can build Unix or
   SSH connectors without duplicating transport parsing.

Remaining follow-ups:

1. **Add `ssh_options` to `SshProfile`** in
   `cue-client/src/transport_config.rs` and carry it through
   `ResolvedTransport`.
2. **Add remote auto-start logic**: before the first `Ping`, try
   `ssh <destination> <start_command>` once and retry the gateway connection.
   Wrap in a timeout (e.g., 10 s) to avoid blocking reconnect loops.
3. **Add `ServerAliveInterval` defaults or configurable keepalive options** so
   dead SSH connections are detected without waiting for TCP timeout.
4. **Add SSH live-reconnect integration coverage** that avoids requiring a real
   remote SSH server.

## Mode 3: Chain Transport / Proxy Mode

### 3.1 Current State

No chain/relay mode exists. This mode would allow a local `cued` to act as a
transparent proxy to a remote `cued`, enabling topologies like:

```
cue-tui ──Unix──► local-cued ──SSH──► remote-cued
```

Use cases:
- Audit logging / session recording at the local hop
- Credential isolation (the client never touches remote credentials; local cued
  holds the SSH key)
- Multi-hop: `laptop → vpn-gateway-cued → target-cued`
- Offline resilience: local cued can queue commands while remote is unreachable

### 3.2 Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: Transparent proxy (all-forward)

Local `cued` has an "upstream" configuration. Every incoming `Request` from any
local client is forwarded verbatim to the upstream `cued`, and every `Response`
/ `Event` from upstream is fanned out to subscribed local clients.

```
local client A ──► local-cued ─────► remote-cued
local client B ──► local-cued ─╯
```

Local cued maintains one persistent connection to upstream, shares responses and
events across all local clients.

**Pros**:
- Simplest model — local cued is a dumb multiplexer
- No logic duplication, no state divergence between hops
- Clients get exactly the same semantics as a direct connection

**Cons**:
- Local cued cannot run any commands locally (no local job execution)
- Client IDs from local clients must be remapped to avoid collisions on the
  upstream (`client_id` is an opaque u64 on the wire)
- If upstream disconnects, all local clients must be notified

**Mapping concern**: the current IPC protocol carries `client_id` only in
internal actor messages (it is not in the wire `Message` envelope). The wire
protocol carries only `id: u32` (request correlation). So transparent proxying
at the wire level is straightforward: forward the raw bytes.

```
local client ──[raw bytes]──► proxy ──[raw bytes]──► remote-cued
              ◄─────────────────────◄─────────────────────
```

Since `gateway_stdio.rs` already implements exactly this (`io::copy` in both
directions), a Unix-to-Unix proxy just needs to:
1. Accept a Unix connection from the local client
2. Open its own connection to the upstream (Unix or SSH)
3. `io::copy` in both directions

#### Option B: Selective proxy (local + remote commands)

Some commands run on local `cued` (`:ls`, `:scope`, local jobs), others are
forwarded to remote `cued` based on routing rules.

**Pros**:
- Local commands remain fast even when remote is slow/disconnected
- Can mix local and remote jobs in the same TUI session

**Cons**:
- Requires the proxy to parse and route individual IPC messages — breaks the
  simple byte-relay model
- Client would need to distinguish local vs. remote job IDs
- High implementation complexity; scope creep

#### Option C: Mesh topology (multiple cued with shared state)

Multiple `cued` instances synchronize job state over a gossip or consensus
protocol.

**Pros**:
- High availability

**Cons**:
- Requires distributed systems primitives (consensus, conflict resolution)
- Completely out of scope for the current single-daemon model
- No plausible use case that justifies the complexity

### 3.3 Recommended Approach

**Option A — transparent proxy** using raw byte relay, with upstream configured
as either a Unix socket or an SSH transport. Start with a cue-tui-level relay
that does not require any changes to cued's internal actor system.

The simplest useful design requires only:
1. A new `"chain"` transport profile in `client.toml`
2. A `cued relay` subcommand (analogous to `cued gateway --stdio`) that accepts
   a Unix connection and relays it to an upstream socket (Unix or SSH)
3. Or, more powerfully: configure `cued` itself to forward all client
   connections to an upstream

The byte-relay approach re-uses the same implementation behind
`cue_daemon::relay_gateway_stdio` nearly verbatim.

### 3.4 TOML Configuration Schema

**Client-side**: the chain is invisible — the client just configures its
transport to point at the intermediate `cued`. No new client config needed.

**Daemon-side** — `cued` in relay mode:

```toml
# ~/.config/cue-shell/daemon.toml  (on the relay node)

[relay]
enabled = true

# upstream is another cued; described as any standard transport profile
[relay.upstream]
transport = "ssh"
destination = "prod-server"
gateway_command = "cued gateway --stdio"
start_command = "cued start"
```

Or simpler: a one-shot relay via CLI:

```sh
# On the relay machine: accept unix connections and forward them over SSH
cued relay --upstream ssh://prod-server
```

### 3.5 Implementation Steps

1. **Add `cued relay` subcommand** in the daemon CLI (`crates/cue-daemon/src/cli.rs`, surfaced by `cued` and `cue-daemon`) analogous to
   `cued gateway --stdio`:
   - Accept a Unix socket connection
   - Connect to upstream (Unix or SSH using the SSH connector from Mode 2)
   - Run `cue_daemon::relay_gateway_stdio(client_unix, stdin, upstream_stream)` — the
     three-way relay function already works for any `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`

2. **Extend `cued gateway`** to support an `--upstream` flag:

```sh
cued gateway --stdio --upstream ssh://devbox
```

This re-uses the existing `gateway_stdio.rs` relay implementation:

```rust
pub async fn run_relay(stdin: impl AsyncRead, stdout: impl AsyncWrite, upstream: impl AsyncRead + AsyncWrite) -> Result<()> {
    relay(stdin, stdout, upstream).await
}
```

3. **Multi-client multiplexing** (optional, Phase 2): instead of one relay
   per client connection, have the relay actor maintain a single upstream
   connection and multiplex multiple local clients. This requires the proxy to
   parse and route individual `Message` envelopes (breaking pure byte relay),
   but the same `read_message`/`write_message` functions from `cue-core` can be
   reused.

4. **Reconnect**: the relay should reconnect to the upstream using the same
   `spawn_connection_manager` infrastructure from `cue-client`. When upstream
   reconnects, the relay must resubscribe upstream channels and let local
   clients verify readiness through the normal Ping/response path.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Authentication

| Transport | Mechanism                                      | Notes                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Unix      | Filesystem permissions on socket (`0600`)      | Implicit — same user only                  |
| SSH       | SSH authentication (key / agent / password)    | Delegated to OpenSSH                       |
| HTTP/WS   | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on WS upgrade  | Token in daemon config; TLS strongly advised |
| Chain     | Auth at each hop                               | SSH on the relay-to-upstream leg           |

For HTTP, the token should be a random 256-bit hex string. The daemon stores
accepted token material in `~/.config/cue-shell/daemon.toml` with `chmod 600`;
clients reference the matching token from their `client.toml` transport profile.

### TLS

- **Unix**: N/A (kernel-level isolation)
- **SSH**: TLS not needed (SSH provides encryption)
- **HTTP/WS**: optional for LAN; required for WAN. Use `rustls` (no C
  dependencies). `axum-server` with a `RustlsConfig` acceptor.
- TLS is a feature flag: `cued` starts in plaintext mode unless a cert/key are
  configured. Clients use `ws://` vs `wss://` accordingly.

### Connection Health

All transports should implement keepalives to detect dead connections quickly:

| Transport | Mechanism                                           |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Unix      | OS detects dead socket; read returns `BrokenPipe`   |
| SSH       | `ServerAliveInterval=10` in SSH flags               |
| HTTP/WS   | WebSocket ping/pong frames (via `axum` / tungstenite) every 30 s |
| Chain     | Inherited from the upstream transport               |

The reconnect manager (`run_connection_manager_with_delay`) already handles
disconnect detection and retry. Adding keepalive timers only reduces the *time
to detect* a dead connection.

### Error Handling

- **Transport errors** (connection refused, timeout): propagated as
  `ConnectionEvent::Disconnected` → reconnect loop.
- **Auth errors** (HTTP 401, SSH auth failure): should surface as a fatal error
  with a clear message, not silently retried.
- **Protocol mismatch**: the `Ping/Pong` handshake after every new connection
  (already used by SSH transport) should be the standard health check for all
  transports.

---

## Priority Order

### Priority 1: SSH Transport Follow-ups

**Why first**: The core SSH stream and connector path is in place in
`cue-client`, and `cue-tui` can now reuse that connector for live target
switching. The remaining high-value work is UX hardening:

1. Add `ssh_options` + `auto_start` fields to cue-client transport config.
2. Add remote auto-start and keepalive behavior.
3. Add integration coverage for reconnecting through an SSH-shaped connector
   without requiring a real remote SSH server.

**Effort estimate**: ~1–2 days. No new dependencies are required unless we add
an optional SSH helper crate later.

### Priority 2: HTTP Transport

**Why second**: Enables web UIs, IDE plugins, Docker/container environments
where Unix sockets are not accessible. The `ClientStream` abstraction means the
client side is ~100 lines of adapter code.

**Effort estimate**: ~3–5 days. New dependencies: `axum`, `tokio-tungstenite`.

### Priority 3: Chain Transport

**Why third**: The simplest `cued relay` form is trivially built on top of the
SSH transport work (Priority 1) and `cue_daemon::relay_gateway_stdio`. Full multiplexing
(one upstream connection for N local clients) is a Phase 2 enhancement.

**Effort estimate**: ~1–2 days for simple relay; ~1 week for multiplexed relay.

### SSH Child Stdin/Stdout → `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`

Implemented in `cue-client/src/ssh_transport.rs` as `SshChildStream` / the SSH
stdio transport and exposed through `cue_client::transport_connector` for
CLI/TUI reuse.
